# Lab evaluation of Gryon pennsylvanicum as prospective biological control agent to Leptoglossus zontus

## Project at a glace:

This project identifies the demographic and reproductive parameters of parasitoid wasp Gryon pennsylvanicum on its host Leptoglossus zonatus under controlled laboratory conditions. These finding help determine the prospects of G. pennsylvanicum as a successful biological control agent to L. zonatus in applied agricultural settings.
