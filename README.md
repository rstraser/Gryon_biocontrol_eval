# Lab evaluation of Gryon pennsylvanicum as prospective biological control agent to Leptoglossus zontus

## Tl;dr

Scope: Project using personally collected data on biology and reproduction of a parasitic wasp to evaluate as an alternative to insectide use in agriculure.
Goal: Identifying the longevity and reproductive capacity of parasitic wasp Gryon pennsylvanicum on host leaffooted bug.


## Abstract

This project identifies the demographic and reproductive parameters of parasitoid wasp Gryon pennsylvanicum on its host Leptoglossus zonatus under controlled laboratory conditions. These finding help determine the prospects of G. pennsylvanicum as a successful biological control agent to L. zonatus in applied agricultural settings.
