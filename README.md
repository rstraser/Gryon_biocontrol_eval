# Lab evaluation of Gryon pennsylvanicum as prospective biological control agent to Leptoglossus zontus

## Tl;dr

* Natural enemies, such as parasitic wasps, can help control pests in agriculure. 
* Identifying the biology and reproductive traits of a natural enemy is important to project its success as a biocontrol agent. 
* Here, I explore these traits from Gryon pennsylvanicum on host Leptoglossus zonatus.

## About the project

### The problem

The western leaffooted bug, _Leptoglossus zonatus_, is becoming a major pest in California tree nut crops such as almond and pistachio. Feeding damage from these pests can cause significant economic loss for growers. Given the lack of suffient monitoring tactics, broad-spectrum insectides remain the primary control tactic for the pest. Reliance on such methods can be economically and environemental unsustainable. In response to a growing demand from growers for more sustainable management options, we explored the potential utility of parasitic wasp _Gryon pennsylvanicum_ as a biological control agent to _L. zonatus_.

### The solution 

The use of parasitic wasps for the natural control of insect pest populations (biological control) has the potential to provide numerous economic and environmental benefits. If successful, biological control can reduce pest populations, alleviating reliance on commerical insecticides, saving growers time and money all while reducing the negative effects of frequent use of insecticides on people and the environment. 

### The question

Understanding the demographical and reproductive parameters of a natural enemy is paramount in evaluating it's potential use in biological control programs. Here, we conducted a laboratory evaluation on _G. pennsylvanicum_ as a prospective biological control agent to _L. zonatus_.
