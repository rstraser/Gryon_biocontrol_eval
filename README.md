# Lab evaluation of Gryon pennsylvanicum as prospective biological control agent to Leptoglossus zontus

## Project at a glace:

- Understanding the demographic and reproductive parameters of a natural enemy are fundemental in evaluting its potential success as a biological control agent in applied settings. This project explores the biology and reproductive capacity of parasitic wasp Gryon pennsylvanicum on promenent agricultural pest the leaffooted bug.
- Project tools: R (libraries: xxx, xxx, xxx, xxx)
- Dataset: laboratory collections
- Whats the take home?



This project identifies the demographic and reproductive parameters of parasitoid wasp Gryon pennsylvanicum on its host Leptoglossus zonatus under controlled laboratory conditions. These finding help determine the prospects of G. pennsylvanicum as a successful biological control agent to L. zonatus in applied agricultural settings.
